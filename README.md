# Design patterns in Python

### What are design patterns?
 - Design patterns are reusable programming solutions for
   recurring design problems in Object oriented systems.
 - These patterns are considered as optimized solutions after analysing multiple possible solutions

### What are different types of design patterns ?
 - Design patterns categorised mainly in three parts:
   - [Creational](creational) : Provides various object creation mechanisms, it increases flexibility and reuse of existing code
     - [Abstract Factory](creational/abstract_factory)
     - [Factory method](creational/factory)
     - [Prototype](creational/prototype)
     - [Singleton](creational/singleton.py)
     - [Builder](creational/builder.py)
   - [Structural](structural) : It explains how to create classes and objects in larger system and keep to them flexible and efficient
     - [Adapter](structural/adapter.py)
     - [Bridge](structural/bridge_pattern.py)
     - [Decorator](structural/decorator.py)
     - [Facade](structural/facade.py)
     - [Flyweight](structural/flyweight.py)
     - [Proxy](structural/proxy.py)
   - [Behavioral](behavioral) : These are related to how objects should communicate to each other in larger structure
     - [Chain of responsibility](behavioral/chain_of_responsibilty.py)
     - [Command](behavioral/command.py)
     - [Observer](behavioral/observer.py)
